# Project Name

Clean architecture using Fluent

## Overview

This project is built on .NET 8 and follows Clean Architecture principles, employing Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Fluent Validation, and exposing a Swagger API for easy documentation and testing.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns into layers (Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) for better maintainability and testability.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Modeling the domain entities, aggregates, value objects, and repositories to closely align with business requirements.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separating read and write operations for improved scalability, performance, and maintainability.
- **Fluent Validation:** Declarative validation rules to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Swagger API:** Interactive API documentation and testing through Swagger UI.
